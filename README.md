# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Prelude

While AI tools—especially large language models—have helped us enormously, over-reliance on them can erode expertise and encourage laziness. To counter that, I’m building a series of projects from scratch using only my own knowledge, and I hope it inspires you to do the same.

## Introduction

Among the many projects in data science and machine learning, credit card fraud detection is one of the most practical ways to sharpen your skills and tackle real-world challenges.

In this repository, I’ll follow the same steps I use in my day-to-day work: reinforcing essential techniques, learning new ones, and showing readers how to approach a mission-critical task. I’ll update this README as the project evolves, documenting each checklist item and milestone along the way.
