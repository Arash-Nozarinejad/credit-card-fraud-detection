# Step 6 - Data Cleaning

Based on step 5, we see that there no need for any data cleaning step for this particular project and the dataset is ready for step 7.

Usually, rectifying steps would be taken to fix:
1. Missing Data
2. Incorrect Data Types
3. Outliers and Anamolies
4. Duplicates
5. Structural problems
6. Target Variable problems

After data cleaning I run a post-cleaning validation EDA to check if the problems were all addressed. Depending on the severity of the problem sometimes graphs and formulas had to be used but in this project nothing is needed.
